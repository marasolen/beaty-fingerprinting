            <p>
                For each row, there is a "Petri dish" and a set of vials. The Petri dish itself is red if I identified a specimen
                that I interpreted as dangerous in the row, and grey otherwise. The "organisms" in the Petri dishes represent groups
                of specimens in the row. There are three attributes: size, aquatic to terrestrial, and flies vs doesn't fly. Each
                organism is a specific combination of these three attributes. For example, one organism may represent Small 
                Terrestrial organisms that can Fly. The size of the organism represents how many specimens match that combination of
                attributes within the row, and the colour gradient represents the attributes, with size in the centre, ability to
                fly on the outside, and aquatic to terrestrial in between. Below the Petri dish is a set of "vials" which is
                essentially a bar chart of the counts of the different attributes within the row, and acts as a sort of legend for 
                the organisms as well. I also kept track of how many of each organism's specimens were images vs objects, and 
                whether the row had any "hidden" specimens (ie specimens in drawers), but I haven't visually encoded either of those
                things yet.
